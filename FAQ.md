### What is SeamlessAccess.org?

SeamlessAccess.org is a service, based on the findings of the Resource Access for the 21st Century ([RA21](https://ra21org)) initiative, designed to help foster a more streamlined online access experience when using scholarly collaboration tools, information resources, and shared research infrastructure. The service promotes digital authentication leveraging an existing single-sign-on infrastructure through one’s home institution, while maintaining an environment that protects personal data and privacy.


### How is SeamlessAccess.org governed?

SeamlessAccess.org is committed to ensuring all stakeholders are represented in governance of the service. Current coalition members include representatives from [GÉANT](https://geant.org), [Internet2](https://internet2.edu), the National Information Standards Organization ([NISO](https://niso.org)), [ORCID](https://orcid.org), and the International Association of STM Publishers ([STM](https://stm-assoc.org)). Technical Steering includes individuals from GEANT, Internet2, OARnet, Stanford University, and Duke University 


### How does SeamlessAccess.org take into account user privacy?

User privacy is one of the guiding principles of the SeamlessAccess.org service. The General Data Protection Regulation and the e-privacy regulation proposal arising from the EU provide a set of legal requirements that inform the configuration and use of the service. 

SeamlessAccess.org uses SAML federated authentication technology, which has in-built mechanisms for preserving privacy. No information can be shared about the user without action on the part of the user's institution. Typically, academic SAML Identity Providers provide unique, persistent, but opaque identifiers, which provides a way for service providers (SPs) to personalize services for users without knowing the actual identity of the individual. Optionally, SPs may then ask for additional personal information from users via their normal registration processes, disclosing their privacy policies, in order to provide services which require the publisher to know the identity of the user, such as email alerts.

### How is federated access relevant in the world of open access publishing?

Librarians are responsible for providing access to a vast array of information sources, not just journals. Access to books, databases and other online resources and services will also be improved.

The use of the SeamlessAccess.org service can also be implemented in manuscript submission systems, editorial review tools, pre-print servers, etc, easing the difficulties users have today in managing multiple accounts and passwords for these tools, and potentially allowing usage reporting on the institutional level, supporting the reporting and compliance requirements of institutions.

At present, libraries have no way of measuring usage of freely available information resources by their patrons. Depending on the access mechanism selected, it may be possible for librarians to better understand the patterns of usage of their patrons /across all information resources.
    

### How will federated access to library material work for the walk-in user at a library?

This is definitely an area which will need special attention. Using federated access does not imply using only login credentials. Institutions will be free to use different authentication methods for different classes of users. They could, for example, use smart cards, one-time access codes, certificates installed on library workstations, or even  continue to use the IP address authorization for on-site usage, or may transition to a guest account service. It is up to the library and its associated institution to make these decisions.
