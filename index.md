  ## Seamless Access
---

SeamlessAccess.org = simple, trusted use of scholarly resources and services anytime, anywhere, and on any device.

SeamlessAccess.org builds on the [guidelines](https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-27-2019-ra21) resulting from the Resource Access in the 21st Century ([RA21](https://ra21.org)) initiative. The service is kicking off the beta phase, where we will work to ensure the stability, functionality, security, usability, broad applicability, and fitness for purpose of the service.
